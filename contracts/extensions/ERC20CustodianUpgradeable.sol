/**
 * @dev Extension of {ERC20Upgradeable} that allows to implement a custodian
 * mechanism that can be managed by an authorized account with the
 * {freeze} function.
 *
 * This is the upgradeable version of OpenZeppelin Community's ERC20Custodian.
 *
 * This mechanism allows a custodian (e.g. a DAO or a
 * well-configured multisig) to freeze and unfreeze the balance
 * of a user.
 *
 * The frozen balance is not available for transfers or approvals
 * to other entities to operate on its behalf. The frozen balance
 * can be reduced by calling {freeze} again with a lower amount.
